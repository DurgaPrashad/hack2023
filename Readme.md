Overview
This project involves audio processing and transcription using deep learning models. It includes components for preprocessing audio data, training transcription models, and making predictions on new audio samples.

Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the necessary datasets or provide your own audio data in the specified format.
Usage
Preprocessing Audio Data
Run preprocess_audio.py to convert audio files into preprocessed JSON format.
Adjust the directory paths in the script to point to your audio files.
Training the Transcription Model
Run train_model.py to train the transcription model.
Modify the script to load your desired dataset and adjust model parameters if needed.
Evaluating the Model
Use the trained model to transcribe new audio samples by running transcribe_audio.py.
Provide the path to the directory containing the new .wav files when prompted.
Additional Components
ramraj.py: Contains preprocessing functions for audio data.
jaisriram.py: Defines the AudioDataset class for handling audio data as PyTorch datasets.
hanuman.py: Includes components for the transcription model.
jaihanuman.py: Defines the encoder, decoder, and Seq2Seq model.
README.md: Provides project documentation and instructions.

Working with Audio and Transcriptions
Loading and Handling Audio Files
You can utilize the wave module in Python to handle .wav files. Here's an example of how to open a .wav file:

python
import wave

open the Final-out
in that you will find the outputs.py


# Open the .wav file
with wave.open('FOR_EVAL/FOR_EVAL/TEST_FILES/IN_ENGLISH_TEST/1.wav', 'rb') as wav_file:
    # Do something with the .wav file
    pass
Accessing Transcriptions from JSON Files
JSON files can store transcriptions or other data associated with audio files. Here's how to read a transcription from a JSON file:

python
Copy code
import json

# Open the .json file
with open('Englih/1.json', 'r') as json_file:
    transcription = json.load(json_file)
    print(transcription)  # Print the transcription
Note
Ensure that the file paths provided in the code are accurate and point to the respective .wav and .json files you intend to work with.




#it will conver the wav file into json using ptorch  trained data model it will transfer  in transcriptioon  and show it in the output it want to run in certain formet
